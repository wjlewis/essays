        <h1>Priority Queues using Binary Heaps</h1>

        <p>
          Suppose you want to write a task scheduler with the following
          properties: each task has a priority, tasks can be added in any order,
          and tasks should be removed according to their priority. A simple
          solution is to use an array and re-sort the elements every time a task
          is added. However, sorting is a lot of work, and it's&mdash;perhaps
          surprisingly&mdash;more work than needs to be done in this case. As
          we'll see, we still require
          <em>some</em> order, just not the <em>total</em> order of a sorted
          array. What we need is a <em>binary heap</em>.
        </p>

        <h2>Binary Heaps</h2>

        <p>
          &ldquo;Heap&rdquo; is unfortunately a rather ambiguous term, and
          doubly so in computing. For our purposes, a heap is nothing more than
          a binary tree with a special property. Specifically, a binary tree is
          a heap if
          <em>every parent node is greater than or equal to its children</em>.
        </p>

        <p>Here's a heap:</p>

        <img src="./assets/heap1.svg" alt="An example heap" />

        <p>And another:</p>

        <img src="./assets/heap2.svg" alt="Another heap" />

        <p>
          Notice that in both cases, the greatest element (9) appears at the
          root. This is always the case: the greatest element in a heap can't
          have a parent, because each parent must be greater than or equal to
          its children. So it must be at the root. Furthermore, each
          <em>subtree</em> in the examples above has the heap property. This is
          also a necessary property of heaps.
        </p>

        <p>Here are some trees that <em>don't</em> have the heap property:</p>

        <img src="./assets/non-heap1.svg" alt="Not a heap" />

        <img src="./assets/non-heap2.svg" alt="Another non-heap" />

        <p>
          In the first tree, 6 is a parent of 9, and 2 is a parent of 5. These
          are two violations of the heap property. What about the second tree,
          in which every parent is greater than or equal to its children? This
          tree fails to satisfy an additional property that heaps must have that
          we haven't yet mentioned. For reasons which will soon be made clear,
          we want heaps to be nice and compact, so in addition to the
          &ldquo;heap property&rdquo; outlined above, we also require that every
          generation be &ldquo;filled&rdquo;, except for possibly the last.
          Furthermore, if the last generation is not filled, we require that the
          nodes in it be &ldquo;packed&rdquo; to the left.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Adding and Removing Elements</h2>

        <p>
          At this point, heaps appear to be little more than binary trees with
          some rather arbitrary qualities. However, recall that the largest
          element in a heap is always at the root. To return to our motivating
          example (a scheduler), if we have a collection of tasks arranged in a
          heap, then the highest priority task is always located at the root. To
          return the highest priority task then, we simple remove and return the
          root.
        </p>

        <img src="./assets/rm-root.svg" alt="Removing a heap's root element" />

        <p>
          But now we no longer have a heap. We'd like to combine the leftovers
          into a <em>new</em> heap, so that the next time we want to remove the
          highest priority task, we can simply pluck off the root as we did
          here.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is where the (perhaps arbitrary-seeming) heap property shines. We
          first move the bottom-most, left-most element into the root position.
        </p>

        <img src="./assets/replace-root.svg" alt="Replacing the root" />

        <p>
          Now we've reconnected our tree, but the tree is <em>not</em> a heap.
          To restore the heap property, we first compare the new root element
          with its two children.
        </p>

        <img
          src="./assets/compare-root.svg"
          alt="Comparing the root with its children"
        />

        <p>
          If it's smaller than either (and it's smaller than both in this case),
          we swap it with its <em>larger</em> child (6).
        </p>

        <img
          src="./assets/swap-root.svg"
          alt="Swapping the root and its larger child"
        />

        <p>
          We then continue, with our focus now on the subtree into which we
          swapped the root. We compare the subtree's root (2) with its children
          (1 and 1).
        </p>

        <img
          src="./assets/compare-new-root.svg"
          alt="Comparing the new root with its children"
        />

        <p>
          But since the root is greater than or equal to both children, we stop.
          We've successfully restored the heap property.
        </p>

        <p>
          This process of repeatedly comparing the tree's root with its children
          and swapping if necessary is called &ldquo;sifting down&rdquo;, and it
          converts any &ldquo;compact&rdquo; (in the sense described above)
          binary tree into a heap.
        </p>

        <p>
          How does it work? After removing the root, we are left with two
          disconnected subtrees, but these subtrees are themselves both
          <em>heaps</em>. We then replaced the root with the bottom-most,
          left-most element (the only reason we choose this element is because
          it's the only one we can remove without destroying the tree's
          &ldquo;compactness&rdquo;). If this new root is greater than or equal
          to both its children, the new tree is a heap (since the root is
          greater than its children, which are greater than their children, and
          so on). If it's smaller than one of its children, we swap it with the
          <em>greater</em> of its two children. After this swap, the greatest
          element in the tree now sits at the root, and every element in the
          &ldquo;unswapped&rdquo; subtree is smaller than the new root element.
          Now only the &ldquo;swapped&rdquo; subtree needs to be re-heaped. We
          stop when either the root is greater than or equal to its children, or
          we reach the bottom of the tree.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the worst case, how many iterations does this require? At most
          <code>log(n)</code>, where <code>n</code> is the number of nodes in
          the tree. This is (potentially) <em>significantly</em> faster than
          re-sorting all of the elements, which might take
          <code>n * log(n)</code> steps.
        </p>

        <p>
          How about adding new elements to a heap? We'll again need to re-heap
          the tree, but this time starting with the added element. This process
          is called &ldquo;sifting up&rdquo; and ought to have a familiar feel
          to it.
        </p>

        <p>
          We add new elements in the bottom-most, left-most position (starting a
          new generation if necessary).
        </p>

        <img src="./assets/add-element.svg" alt="Adding an element to a heap" />

        <p>We then compare the new element with its parent.</p>

        <img
          src="./assets/compare-parent.svg"
          alt="Comparing the element with its parent"
        />

        <p>
          If it's greater (as it is here), we swap the two; otherwise, we stop.
        </p>

        <img
          src="./assets/swap-new-element.svg"
          alt="Swapping the new element with its parent"
        />

        <p>We then repeat this process.</p>

        <img
          src="./assets/compare-swapped.svg"
          alt="Comparing the swapped element with its parent"
        />

        <p>
          This time, however, the element is not greater than its parent, so
          we're done. The heap property has been restored.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sifting up works for more-or-less the same reason that sifting-down
          does. In particular, it relies heavily on the fact that subtrees of
          heaps are themselves heaps. There's also a subtle point to be made
          here. Notice how the first two example heaps contain the exact same
          elements; they both have the heap property, and yet they're different
          trees. Unlike sorted arrays, which are uniquely determined by their
          elements, heaps permit a looser, more fluid organization. In a sense,
          the heap property requires <em>just the right amount of order</em>. As
          a result, re-heaping is quick.

        <h2>A Compact Representation</h2>

        <p>
          Now that we understand the essential operations on heaps, we're ready
          to think about representation. &ldquo;Compact&rdquo; binary trees,
          like the ones we're concerned with here, permit a particular efficient
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_data_structure"
            target="_blank"
            ><em>implicit</em></a
          >
          representation. While a more general recursive representation will do,
          the one we'll show here is far superior in terms of both memory usage,
          cache-locality, and more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Specifically, a &ldquo;compact&rdquo; binary tree&mdash;in which every
          generation except for possibly the last is completely filled&mdash;can
          be represented using nothing more than an array with one element for
          each item in the tree. To encode a tree, its elements are stored in a
          breadth-first order: first the root, then its two children, then the
          nodes in the next generation, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's the first example heap from above, along with its implicit
          array representation:
        </p>

        <img
          src="./assets/heap1-rep.svg"
          alt="The first heap, represented as an array"
        />

        <p>
          Using this represention, the left child of the node stored at index
          <code>i</code> is located at index <code>2i + 1</code>, and the right
          child at <code>2i + 2</code>. The parent of the node at index
          <code>i</code> is located at index
          <code>&#x230a;(i - 1) / 2&#x230b;</code>, where
          <code>&#x230a;n&#x230b;</code> is the greatest integer less than or
          equal to <code>n</code> (the &ldquo;floor&rdquo; function).
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider the node whose value is 6. It's stored at index
          <code>1</code>, so its children can be found at indexes
          <code>2 * 1 + 1 = 3</code> and <code>2 * 1 + 2 = 4</code>. Likewise,
          the node whose value is 2 is stored at index <code>5</code>, and its
          parent&mdash;5&mdash;can be found at index
          <code>&#x230a;(5 - 1) / 2&#x230b; = 2</code>.

        <h2>An Implementation in TypeScript</h2>

        <p>
          We'll now work through an implementation in TypeScript (although any
          language with mutable arrays will do). To start, let's create a file
          called
          <code>binary-heap.ts</code> and add a skeleton:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="hl-typescript">class BinaryHeap {
  private elements: number[] = [];

  isEmpty(): boolean {
    throw new Error('unimplemented');
  }

  push(x: number) {
    throw new Error('unimplemented');
  }

  peek(): number | null {
    throw new Error('unimplemented');
  }

  pop(): number | null {
    throw new Error('unimplemented');
  }
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          Note that we've decided to return
          <code>null</code> in the event that a user <code>peek</code>s or
          <code>pop</code>s an empty heap. Alternatively, we could throw an
          error, or return something like Rust's <code>Option</code> type.
        </p>

        <p>
          We'll store our heap using the <code>elements</code> array. Thus, to
          check if the heap is empty, we simply need to check if the elements
          array has length <code>0</code>:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="hl-typescript">isEmpty(): boolean {
  return this.elements.length === 0;
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          Let's tackle <code>pop</code> next. If the heap is empty, we'll simply
          return <code>null</code>. If it's not, we need to store the element at
          index <code>0</code> (this is the root), move the element at the last
          index (this is the bottom-most, left-most node) to index
          <code>0</code>, and &ldquo;sift down&rdquo;. Finally, we'll return the
          previous root element.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="hl-typescript">class BinaryHeap {
  // ...

  pop(): number | null {
    if (this.elements.length === 0) {
      return null;
    }

    // Save the current root
    const root = this.elements[0];

    const last = this.elements.pop() as number;
    if (root !== last) {
      // Move the bottom-most, left-most node into the root's position
      this.elements[0] = last;

      // Sift down
      this.siftDown();
    }

    return root;
  }

  private siftDown() {
    throw new Error('unimplemented');
  }

  // ...
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          Recall how <code>siftDown</code> works: we compare a parent node to
          its children. If either of the children is greater than the parent, we
          swap the parent with the <em>greater</em> of the two. We stop whenever
          the current parent node is greater than or equal to its children (or
          has no children). Here's what that looks like:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="hl-typescript">private siftDown() {
  // Start at the root
  let parentIndex = 0;

  while (true) {
    const lChildIndex = 2 * parentIndex + 1;
    const rChildIndex = 2 * parentIndex + 2;

    const parentValue = this.elements[parentIndex];
    const lChildValue = this.elements[lChildIndex];
    const rChildValue = this.elements[rChildIndex];

    if (
      (lChildValue && lChildValue > parentValue) ||
      (rChildValue && rChildValue > parentValue)
    ) {
      // A swap is required
      if (rChildValue && rChildValue > lChildValue) {
        // Swap with right child
        this.elements[rChildIndex] = parentValue;
        this.elements[parentIndex] = rChildValue;
        parentIndex = rChildIndex;
      } else {
        // Swap with left child
        this.elements[lChildIndex] = parentValue;
        this.elements[parentIndex] = lChildValue;
        parentIndex = lChildIndex;
      }
    } else {
      // The parent is greater than its children (or has none)
      break;
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          By way of a break, let's implement <code>peek</code> next. Since the
          root is stored at index <code>0</code>, <code>peek</code> just needs
          to return this value (or <code>null</code> if the heap is empty).
        </p>

        <pre><code class="hl-typescript">peek(): number | null {
  if (this.elements.length === 0) {
    return null;
  }

  return this.elements[0];
}</code></pre>

        <p>All that now remains is <code>push</code>:</p>

        <pre><code class="hl-typescript">class BinaryHeap {
  // ...

  push(x: number) {
    // Add the new element at the bottom-most, left-most position in the tree
    this.elements.push(x);

    // Then sift up
    this.siftUp();
  }

  private siftUp() {
    throw new Error('unimplemented');
  }

  // ...
}</code></pre>

        <p>Compared to <code>siftDown</code>, <code>siftUp</code> is easy:</p>

        <pre><code class="hl-typescript">siftUp() {
  // Start at the most recently added node
  let focusedIndex = this.elements.length - 1;

  while (focusedIndex > 0) {
    const parentIndex = Math.floor((focusedIndex - 1) / 2);

    const focusedValue = this.elements[focusedIndex];
    const parentValue = this.elements[parentIndex];

    if (focusedValue > parentValue) {
      // A swap is required
      this.elements[focusedIndex] = parentValue;
      this.elements[parentIndex] = focusedValue;
      focusedIndex = parentIndex;
    } else {
      // The focused node is not greater than its parent
      break;
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

        <p>Here's the complete implementation:</p>

        <pre><code class="hl-typescript">class BinaryHeap {
  private elements: number[] = [];

  isEmpty(): boolean {
    return this.elements.length === 0;
  }

        <h2>Generalizing the Element Type</h2>

        <p>
          At the moment, our <code>BinaryHeap</code> is not very useful. It can
          only store numbers, whereas in many cases we'd like to store richer
          types of things. Fortunately, it's not difficult to generalize our
          current class to handle any type of element as long as it can be
          compared.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, let's parameterize our class by some type variable
          <code>A</code>:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="hl-typescript">class BinaryHeap&lt;A&gt; {
  // ...
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          We need to update the type of the <code>elements</code> array: where
          it previously stored only numbers, we'll now store
          <code>&lt;A&gt;</code>s. We'll also have the user provide a comparator
          function when constructing a heap, which we'll store for later use in
          <code>siftUp</code> and <code>siftDown</code>.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="hl-typescript">class BinaryHeap&lt;A&gt; {
  private elements: A[] = [];

  constructor(private greaterThan: (x: A, y: A) => boolean) {}

  // ...
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          Now all that remains is to replace each appropriate occurrence of
          <code>&gt;</code> with the user-provided
          <code>greaterThan</code> function. We also need to update the
          signatures of <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, and
          <code>peek</code> to expect and return elements of type
          <code>A</code>, instead of <code>number</code>s:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="hl-typescript">class BinaryHeap&lt;A&gt; {
  private elements: A[] = [];

  constructor(private greaterThan: (x: A, y: A) => boolean) {}

  isEmpty(): boolean {
    return this.elements.length === 0;
  }

  push(x: A) {
    this.elements.push(x);
    this.siftUp();
  }

  private siftUp() {
    let focusedIndex = this.elements.length - 1;

    while (focusedIndex > 0) {
      const parentIndex = Math.floor((focusedIndex - 1) / 2);

      const focusedValue = this.elements[focusedIndex];
      const parentValue = this.elements[parentIndex];

      if (this.greaterThan(focusedValue, parentValue)) {
        this.elements[focusedIndex] = parentValue;
        this.elements[parentIndex] = focusedValue;
        focusedIndex = parentIndex;
      } else {
        break;
      }
    }

  peek(): A | null {
    if (this.elements.length === 0) {
      return null;

    return this.elements[0];

  pop(): A | null {
    if (this.elements.length === 0) {
      return null;

    const root = this.elements[0];
    const last = this.elements.pop() as A;
    if (root !== last) {
      this.elements[0] = last;
      this.siftDown();
    }

    return root;
  }

  private siftDown() {
    let parentIndex = 0;

    while (true) {
      const lChildIndex = 2 * parentIndex + 1;
      const rChildIndex = 2 * parentIndex + 2;

      const parentValue = this.elements[parentIndex];
      const lChildValue = this.elements[lChildIndex];
      const rChildValue = this.elements[rChildIndex];

      if (
        (lChildValue && this.greaterThan(lChildValue, parentValue)) ||
        (rChildValue && this.greaterThan(rChildValue, parentValue))

      } else {
        break;

        <p>Now, given some <code>Task</code> type, perhaps defined like so:</p>

        <pre><code class="hl-typescript">interface Task {
  priority: number;
  name: string;
}</code></pre>

        <p>we can create a <code>BinaryHeap</code> capable of storing tasks.</p>

        <pre><code class="hl-typescript">const heap = new BinaryHeap&lt;Task&gt;((t1, t2) => t1.priority > t2.priority);

heap.push({ priority: 4, name: 'warning' });
heap.push({ priority: 8, name: 'meltdown' });
heap.push({ priority: 1, name: 'todo' });
heap.push({ priority: 9, name: '!' });

console.log(heap.pop()); // => { priority: 9, name: '!' }
console.log(heap.pop()); // => { priority: 8, name: 'meltdown' }
</code></pre>

        <h2>A Real World Example</h2>

        <p>
          Binary heaps often appear in &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; systems in which
          tasks are constantly created and need to be handled according to their
          priority. As an example, React uses a
          <a
            href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1314299c7f70914d61d8e1cef56767f112110674/packages/scheduler/src/SchedulerMinHeap.js"
            target="_blank"
            >binary heap</a
          >
          in its <code>scheduler</code> package. The scheduler determines when
          various UI-related updates should be performed.
